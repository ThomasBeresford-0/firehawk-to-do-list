## Firehawk To-Do List

This is a simple To-Do List web application integrated with Firebase. It allows users to add, view, mark as complete, and delete to-do items with real-time synchronization across users, styled to match Firehawk Funerals branding.

## Features

- Add Tasks: Users can add new to-do items with a priority level (Low, Medium, High).
- View Tasks: Tasks are displayed in a clean, responsive interface that adapts to both desktop and mobile devices.
- Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks from their list with a simple click.
- Mark Tasks as Complete: Tasks can be marked as completed, visually indicated with a strikethrough.
- Priority Levels: Tasks can be assigned a priority (Low, Medium, High), displayed as colored tags next to each task.
- Real-Time Synchronization: All actions (adding, deleting, completing tasks) are synchronized in real-time across devices using Firebase Firestore.
- Firebase Integration: I used Firebase for data storage, syncing, and real-time updates between users.
- Responsive Design: The app is styled to look good and function well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Basic Form Validation: The app ensures that users cannot add empty to-do items.
- Unit Testing: I set up basic unit tests using Jest to validate the core functionality.
